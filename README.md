# TicTacToe_Project
The Tic Tac Toe project is a classic implementation of the well-known game, designed to be played by two players taking turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of three marks (either "X" or "O") before the opponent does.

The "Tic Tac Toe" project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript brings the classic game to life in a web-based format. The HTML markup structures the game board as a 3x3 grid, creating a visually appealing interface for players to interact with. CSS styling enhances the presentation, offering customizable designs to make the game visually engaging and intuitive to navigate.

JavaScript powers the game's functionality, implementing the logic behind player moves, win conditions, and game state management. Through event listeners and DOM manipulation, JavaScript enables seamless interaction, allowing players to click on grid spaces to place their marks (X or O), updating the display to reflect the current state of the game after each move.

This project demonstrates the power of web development technologies in creating interactive and enjoyable gaming experiences directly within the browser. It showcases the synergy between HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior, providing a comprehensive example of front-end development skills in action.
